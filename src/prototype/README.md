# Prototyping

This is the phase where I go from design to prototype.

## How Do I Go From Design to Prototype?

I take the given design and I reimagine it as an [exploded-view drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploded-view_drawing) that I then use to deconstruct it into its components. I build a [dependency graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph) of all the components such that there is a directed edge from component `A` to component `B` whenever `A` depends on `B`. A [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) of this dependency graph helps me figure out in what order to start working on the components. At this point, I have a choice to take either a bottom-up or top-down approach, and I usually choose the bottom-up approach. For each component, I determine:

1. How I'm going to give it meaning and structure with HTML.
2. How I'm going to refer to its elements using CSS classes.
3. How I'm going to present it, as specified in the design, with CSS rules.

## What Do I Use?

I use [BEM](https://getbem.com/)'s [naming convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) for my CSS classes.

I use [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/) to generate my CSS and I take full advantage of its support for modules via the [`@use`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/) rule.

Overall, both the BEM methodology and Dart Sass are a boon to my prototyping process.

## A Few Details

During prototyping I only use a subset of the directories and scripts.

### Directories

- `.build/prototype` - An ephemeral directory that stores the build output generated by the  `build-prototype` script.
- [`prototype`](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator/tree/1.0.0/prototype) - The HTML files for the prototype.
- [`public/fonts`](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator/tree/1.0.0/public/fonts) - The custom fonts.
- [`sass`](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator/tree/1.0.0/sass) - The Sass files that go into creating the `index.css` file.

### Scripts

- [`build-prototype`](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator/blob/1.0.0/bin/build-prototype) - Builds the prototype and places the build output in the `.build/prototype` directory.
- [`serve-prototype`](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator/blob/1.0.0/init.sh#L58-L60) - Uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)'s [static file server](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/static-files) to serve the `.build/prototype` directory.
