# Introduction

In this tutorial I'll share with you how I built [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) front-end project with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-calculator) for the application we'll be going through and here's a [live demo](https://dwayne.github.io/elm-calculator/) for you to explore how it works.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of [HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html), [CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css), and [JavaScript](https://web.dev/learn/javascript).
- Basic knowledge of Elm as provided by the [official Elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).
- And most importantly of all, a desire to learn and understand how things work.

## Learning Outcomes

Here's some of what you can expect to learn by reading this tutorial:

- A repeatable process for building any Elm web application.
- How to use [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox).
- How to structure your folders.
- How to build and deploy any Elm web application using Bash scripts.
- How to prototype with HTML/CSS.
- How to structure your HTML/CSS with [BEM](https://getbem.com/).
- A bottom-up approach for building bulletproof UIs with HTML/CSS that's easy to maintain.
- How to design the API for your Elm views.
- How to test your Elm views in a sandbox environment.
- How to separate your application logic from your UI.
- How to model the domain of your application.
- How to build reusable modules.
- How to implement a module for [Rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).
- How to display Rational numbers using [decimal notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal). For e.g. `5/6` gets displayed as the repeating decimal `0.8(3)`.
- How to implement a module for a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).
- How to evaluate infix expressions using [Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm).
- How to parse user input using a [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
- How to write unit tests.

My sincere hope is that you leave with knowledge that you can readily apply in your own projects.

Let's begin!
