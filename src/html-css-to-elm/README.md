# Translating

At this point in the process I am usually highly confident in the reliability of my user interface. I built and tested the user interface independent of any JavaScript framework, independent of any application logic, and closely following web development best practices and standards as far as I understand it.

I now begin introducing Elm into the process and I continue to keep my focus on the user interface.

The goal of this part of the process is to use `elm/html` to abstract over the HTML/CSS that I created during the prototyping phase so that I can compose the components in any way I chose.

**TODO:** Explain your approach.
