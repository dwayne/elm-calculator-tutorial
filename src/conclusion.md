# Conclusion

I touched on a large variety of ideas in the tutorial and glossed over a lot of stuff. If you felt overwhelmed then that's completely understandable. The tutorial wasn't designed to spoon-feed you information. It was merely written to show you how I approach the task of building a non-trivial web application with Elm so that the end result is reliable, maintainable, and testable. Now that you've been exposed to these ideas I hope you take the time to reflect on your own approach to web application development and see how it changes the way you think about Elm and web application development in general.

## Key Takeways

- The user interface (UI) and the application logic can be developed and tested independently of each other.
- The UI can be implemented to completion within a frontend workshop environment long before it needs to be translated to `elm/html`.
- Figuring out how to structure your HTML, write your CSS rules, and script your interactive JavaScript logic is still the hard part of web development but once you figure out how to do it the translation to Elm is typically a straightforward process. `elm/html` is the final technology within which your UI will be written but it doesn't mean you have to start there.
- Elm doesn't prevent you from thinking in terms of components. In fact, the Elm language has excellent features to support component driven UI development.
- Component driven UI development does NOT lead to nested TEA. They are entirely distinct concepts and one does NOT imply the other. What Evan talks about when he talks about components is separate from component driven UI development.
- Elm supports domain-driven development and turns it into a delightful experience. And, that last part is not opinionated at all. ðŸ˜‰

Thank you for taking your time to read the tutorial. I hope it was worthwhile for you.
